# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Supabase Integration

### Local Development Setup

1. Install Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Start local Supabase: `supabase start`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for production or `development.env` for local development
4. Run migrations: `supabase db push`

### Environment Configuration

- Production: Uses `.env` file with remote Supabase credentials
- Development: Uses `development.env` with local Supabase credentials
- The app automatically detects environment via `NODE_ENV`

### Database Synchronization

1. To sync schema changes from local to remote:
   - Export local schema: `supabase db dump -f schema.sql`
   - Apply to remote: `supabase db remote set` then `supabase db push`

2. To pull changes from remote to local:
   - `supabase db remote pull`

### Testing the Connection

1. Start local Supabase: `supabase start`
2. Run the app: `npm start`
3. Verify connection in browser console (should show local Supabase URL)
