# Supabase Frontend-Backend Connection Checklist

## ✅ Connection Setup
- [x] Use environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key
- [x] Configure different settings for development vs production
- [x] Initialize client with recommended auth settings (PKCE flow, session persistence)
- [x] Validate schema/tables exist during development
- [x] Handle missing configuration errors gracefully

## ✅ Query Patterns
- [x] Use consistent query builder pattern (`.from().select().filter()`)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all queries
- [ ] Use `.single()` when expecting exactly one result
- [ ] Apply appropriate ordering for lists
- [ ] Consider pagination for large datasets

## ✅ Data Fetching
- [ ] Create reusable query functions for common operations
- [ ] Cache queries using React Query or similar
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Handle empty states gracefully
- [ ] Consider optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## ✅ Mutations
- [ ] Use transactions for complex operations
- [ ] Validate data before sending to backend
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Provide user feedback on success/failure
- [ ] Consider optimistic updates where appropriate

## ✅ Subscriptions
- [ ] Use proper channel naming conventions
- [ ] Clean up subscriptions when unmounting
- [ ] Handle subscription errors
- [ ] Debounce rapid updates if needed
- [ ] Consider performance impact of real-time updates

## ✅ Security
- [x] Never expose service role keys in frontend (confirmed in supabase.js)
- [x] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies (verified in migrations)
- [ ] Validate all user input
- [x] Use proper authentication flow (PKCE recommended) (confirmed in supabase.js)
- [x] Handle token refresh properly (autoRefreshToken enabled)

## ✅ Performance
- [ ] Limit returned columns with `.select()`
- [ ] Use filters to reduce data transfer
- [ ] Consider denormalizing data for frequent joins
- [ ] Implement client-side caching
- [ ] Batch operations where possible

## ✅ Development Practices
- [ ] Use local Supabase instance for development
- [ ] Implement schema validation in dev mode
- [ ] Log errors to console in development
- [ ] Test with RLS policies enabled
- [ ] Document API usage patterns

## ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Catch and handle Supabase errors consistently
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Log errors appropriately
- [ ] Handle network connectivity issues
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures

## ✅ Code Organization
- [x] Centralize Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Create API adapters for each resource
- [ ] Separate query logic from UI components
- [ ] Document API contracts
- [ ] Type all API responses

## Recommended Improvements
1. Standardize error handling across all API calls
2. Implement consistent logging for API errors
3. Add TypeScript types for all Supabase responses
4. Document API usage patterns in each adapter
5. Consider creating a unified query builder utility
6. Implement proper cancellation for in-flight requests
7. Add performance metrics for API calls
