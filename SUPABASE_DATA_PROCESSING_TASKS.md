# Supabase Data Processing Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the steps to implement best practices for data processing between the frontend and backend using Supabase.

## General Setup

- [x] Install Supabase client library in the frontend project.
- [x] Install Supabase client library in the backend project or set up Supabase Edge Functions environment. (Manual steps provided)
- [x] Configure Supabase client with your project URL and `anon` key (frontend) or `service_role` key (backend/Edge Functions).

## Frontend Implementation

- [x] Implement data fetching using the Supabase client library for displaying information. (Completed: Refactored all API files in `src/apis/` to use `supabaseHelper`)
- [ ] Implement real-time subscriptions for data that needs to update in the UI automatically.
- [ ] Add initial client-side data validation for user input forms.

## Database Configuration (Supabase)

- [ ] Review and refine Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to enforce access control based on user roles and ownership.
- [ ] Implement specific RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations as needed for each table.
- [ ] Consider adding appropriate database indexes to frequently queried columns for performance optimization.

## Backend / Edge Functions Implementation

- [ ] Implement comprehensive server-side data validation for all incoming data before interacting with the database.
- [ ] Move sensitive business logic and data transformations from the frontend to the backend or Supabase Edge Functions.
- [ ] Create API endpoints (using your backend framework or Edge Functions) for frontend to interact with for data mutations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE).
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of your Supabase `service_role` key and other secrets (e.g., using environment variables).

## Data Processing Flow

- [ ] Rearchitect data mutation workflows to go through the backend/Edge Functions instead of directly from the frontend to the database (for sensitive operations).

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Set up monitoring for your Supabase project using the provided tools.
- [ ] Regularly review Supabase logs to identify errors or performance issues.

## Further Considerations

- [ ] Explore using database functions and triggers for complex data logic within the database.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and reporting on both frontend and backend.
