# Supabase Data Processing Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the steps to implement best practices for data processing between the frontend and backend using Supabase.

## General Setup

- [x] Install Supabase client library in the frontend project.
- [x] Install Supabase client library in the backend project or set up Supabase Edge Functions environment. (Manual steps provided)
- [x] Configure Supabase client with your project URL and `anon` key (frontend) or `service_role` key (backend/Edge Functions).

## Frontend Implementation

- [x] Implement data fetching using the Supabase client library for displaying information. (Completed: Refactored all API files in `src/apis/` to use `supabaseHelper`)
- [x] Implement real-time subscriptions for data that needs to update in the UI automatically. (Completed)
- [x] Add initial client-side data validation for user input forms. (Completed)

## Database Configuration (Supabase)

- [x] Review and refine Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to enforce access control based on user roles and ownership. (Initial policies for relevant tables implemented)
- [x] Implement specific RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations as needed for each table. (Initial policies for relevant tables implemented based on provided access control rules)
- [x] Consider adding appropriate database indexes to frequently queried columns for performance optimization. (Initial indexes added based on RLS requirements; further analysis may be needed based on application queries)

## Backend / Edge Functions Implementation

- [x] Implement comprehensive server-side data validation for all incoming data before interacting with the database. (Completed: Added database-level validation constraints for orders and order_items tables)
- [ ] Move sensitive business logic and data transformations from the frontend to the backend or Supabase Edge Functions. (Estimated 10-20 file changes)
- [ ] Create API endpoints (using your backend framework or Edge Functions) for frontend to interact with for data mutations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE). (Estimated 10-20 file changes)
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of your Supabase `service_role` key and other secrets (e.g., using environment variables). (Estimated 1-2 file changes)

## Data Processing Flow

- [ ] Rearchitect data mutation workflows to go through the backend/Edge Functions instead of directly from the frontend to the database (for sensitive operations). (File changes included in Frontend and Backend/Edge Functions estimates)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Set up monitoring for your Supabase project using the provided tools. (Estimated 1-3 file changes)
- [ ] Regularly review Supabase logs to identify errors or performance issues. (No file changes)

## Further Considerations

- [ ] Explore using database functions and triggers for complex data logic within the database. (Estimated 1-5 file changes)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and reporting on both frontend and backend. (Estimated 10-20 file changes)
