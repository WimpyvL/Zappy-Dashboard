# Broken Hooks Analysis Report

## Overview
This document identifies potential issues with React Query hooks and API integrations in the Zappy Health Dashboard application.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Missing Error Handling

Many hooks don't properly handle error states, which can lead to silent failures or poor user experience:

- `src/apis/forms/hooks.js`: The form hooks may not properly handle API errors
- `src/apis/patients/hooks.js`: Patient data fetching hooks need better error handling
- `src/apis/orders/hooks.js`: Order-related hooks should display user-friendly error messages

### 2. Inconsistent Data Transformation

Some hooks don't consistently transform data between API and UI formats:

- `src/apis/forms/hooks.js`: Form structure parsing is inconsistent (see FormsManagement.jsx)
- `src/apis/consultations/hooks.js`: Data transformation may be inconsistent

### 3. Missing Loading States

Some components don't properly handle loading states from hooks:

- `src/pages/settings/pages/forms/FormsManagement.jsx`: Uses loading state but may not show proper loading indicators
- `src/pages/settings/pages/forms/FormViewer.jsx`: Could improve loading state handling

### 4. Potential API Integration Issues

- `src/apis/forms/api.js`: May have incorrect endpoint configurations
- `src/apis/auth/hooks.js`: Authentication hooks may need review for token handling
- `src/apis/insurances/hooks.js`: Insurance API integration may have issues

### 5. Dependency Issues

- Some hooks may be missing dependencies in useEffect arrays
- Potential stale closure issues in callback functions

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Error Handling**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all hooks
   - Use toast notifications or error boundaries for user-friendly error messages

2. **Improve Data Transformation**:
   - Create utility functions for common data transformations
   - Ensure consistent data structure between API and UI

3. **Enhance Loading States**:
   - Add skeleton loaders for better user experience
   - Ensure all components properly handle loading states

4. **Review API Integration**:
   - Verify all API endpoints and parameters
   - Ensure proper authentication token handling

5. **Fix Dependency Arrays**:
   - Review all useEffect dependency arrays
   - Address potential stale closure issues

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize fixes based on user impact
2. Create a testing plan for hook functionality
3. Implement fixes in phases to minimize disruption
4. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
