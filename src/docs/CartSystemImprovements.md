# Cart System Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the cart system and provides guidance for future development.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Standardized Cart Storage Key

- Standardized on `'shoppingCart'` as the localStorage key for all cart-related components
- Updated `CartPage.jsx` to use the same key as `CartContext.jsx`
- This ensures a consistent cart experience across the application

### 2. Added User Feedback for Cart Operations

- Implemented proper error handling with user-visible feedback when products can't be added
- Added toast notifications for cart operations (add, remove, update)
- Added fallback to alert if toast is not available
- This provides better user experience and prevents silent failures

### 3. Improved Prescription Product Handling

- Ensured consistent handling of prescription products between `CartPage.jsx` and `ShoppingCart.jsx`
- Added visual distinction with the RX badge in the shopping cart
- Implemented proper redirection to the intake form for prescription products
- This creates a clear path for users purchasing prescription products

### 4. Added Cross-Selling in Order Confirmation

- Added a "Recommended Products" section to the `OrderConfirmationStep.jsx` component
- Allows users to add non-prescription products to their cart after completing the prescription checkout process
- This increases average order value while maintaining the necessary medical review process for prescription items

## Future Development

### 1. Server-Side Cart Storage

To implement server-side cart storage for cross-device synchronization:

1. Create backend API endpoints for cart operations:
   - `GET /api/cart` - Get the user's cart
   - `POST /api/cart/items` - Add an item to the cart
   - `PUT /api/cart/items/:id` - Update an item in the cart
   - `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id` - Remove an item from the cart
   - `DELETE /api/cart` - Clear the cart

2. Update the `CartContext.jsx` to use these endpoints:
   ```javascript
   const fetchCart = async () => {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('/api/cart');
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch cart');
       const data = await response.json();
       setCartItems(data.items);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching cart:', error);
       // Fall back to localStorage
       const savedCart = localStorage.getItem('shoppingCart');
       return savedCart ? JSON.parse(savedCart) : [];
     }
   };
   ```

3. Implement synchronization between localStorage and server:
   - On login, merge the localStorage cart with the server cart
   - On logout, keep the cart in localStorage for guest users
   - Periodically sync the localStorage cart with the server cart

### 2. Stripe Integration

âœ… Completed:

1. Implemented Stripe Checkout integration with the following components:
   - `paymentService.js`: Main service for handling payment operations
   - `paymentSandbox.js`: Sandbox implementation for testing without real API calls
   - `usePaymentErrorHandler.js`: Hook for handling payment errors and recovery
   - `PaymentMethodSelector.jsx`: UI component for selecting payment methods
   - `DiscountCodeInput.jsx`: UI component for applying discount codes
   - `PaymentErrorRecovery.jsx`: UI component for handling payment errors

2. Added robust error handling for payment failures:
   - Specific error messages for different payment failure scenarios
   - Recovery options based on error type (retry, change payment method, etc.)
   - Graceful handling of session timeouts

3. Implemented discount code functionality:
   - Validation of discount codes
   - Application of discounts to order total
   - Visual feedback for applied discounts

4. Set up API sandbox for testing:
   - Test cards for different payment scenarios
   - Test discount codes
   - Simulated API responses

5. Improved order summary calculations:
   - Accurate subtotal calculation
   - Proper application of discounts
   - Clear display of all charges

For detailed documentation on the payment system implementation, see [Payment System Implementation](./PaymentSystemImplementation.md).

Future enhancements:

1. Add support for saved payment methods
2. Implement subscription management (pause, cancel, upgrade)
3. Add support for alternative payment methods through Stripe

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Always provide user feedback for cart operations
2. **Clear Visual Distinction**: Maintain visual distinction between prescription and non-prescription products
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallbacks for when APIs are unavailable
4. **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Look for opportunities to suggest related products
5. **User Experience**: Focus on creating a seamless checkout experience

## Testing

When testing cart functionality, ensure:

1. Cart items persist across page refreshes
2. Prescription products correctly redirect to the intake form
3. Non-prescription products proceed to regular checkout
4. Error messages are displayed when products can't be added
5. Recommended products can be added to the cart from the order confirmation page
